          "details": "The Florida bonneted bat is a member of the Molossidae (free-tailed bats) family within the order Chiroptera. The species is the largest bat in Florida(Owre 1978; Belwood 1992). Males and females are not significantly different in size, and there is no pattern of size-related geographic variation in this species(Timm and Genoways 2004). Members of the genus Eumops have large, rounded pinnae (ears), arising from a single point or joined medially on the forehead (Best et al. 1997). Ears are joined at the midline of the head. This feature, along with its large size, distinguishes the Florida bonneted bat from the smaller Brazilian (=Mexican)free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis). Eumops are among the narrowest of all molossids (Freeman 1981, as cited in Best et al. 1997) and are well-adapted for rapid, prolonged flight (Vaughan 1959 as cited in Best et al. 1997). This wing structure is conducive to high-speed flight in open areas (Findley et al. 1972 as cited in Best et al. 1997). The Florida bonneted batÃÂ¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s fur is short and glossy, with hairs sharply bicolored with a white base (Belwood 1992; Timm and Genoways 2004). Like other molossids, color is highly variable, varying from black to brown to brownish-gray or cinnamon brown with ventral pelage (fur) paler than dorsal (Owre 1978; Belwood 1992; Timm and Genoways 2004)."

Some males have a white \r\nto yellowish-white superciliary stripe and sometimes touches of white   \r\nelsewhere on the head. They have crowns mottled with black and rufous.  \r\nThe head plumage tends to become purer black with age.  The back\r\nfeathers are a maze of blacks, browns, rufous and buff, somewhat\r\nsimilar to the back patterns of other bobwhite races.\r\n\r\nThe female plumage is mottled brown, buff and white with a buff\r\nthroat and superciliary stripe very similar to females of other \r\nbobwhite races.  It is particularly like the female of C. v. texanus.\r\nFemale masked bobwhite superficially resemble female and juvenile Montezuma quail, Cyrtonyx montezumae.\r\n\r\nGuthery (et al. 2000) conducted a study comparing habitats of Texas bobwhites and masked \r\n\r\nbobwhites in both Arizona and Sonora.  Habitat was determined to be similar for both sub-species,but bobwhites in Texas and Arizona preferred areas with 20-100% coverage of woody vegetation\r\n\r\nwhile Sonoran birds used areas with 9-46% coverage.   Sonoran masked bobwhites selected for \r\n\r\nhigher canopy cover of herbaceous vegetation (34-100%), while Arizona masked bobwhites used \r\n\r\nareas with 17-100% herbaceous cover. Texas bobwhites used areas with 0-30% herbaceous cover.\r\n\r\nIn another study Guthery et al. (2001b) noted that an acceptable range for a particular habitat \r\n\r\ncomponent was influenced by other habitat components.  For example, in Sonora, the acceptable \r\n\r\nrange for canopy coverage of woody vegetation ranged from 0-60% when all other habitat features \r\n\r\nwere at acceptable values, but constricted (15-40%) when other features were not at acceptable \r\n\r\nlevels.  He thereby hypothesized that habitat management could address a deficiency in one habitat \r\n\r\nvariable by managing other variables.\r\n\r\nExposure to aerial predators and high temperatures greatly affects habitat selection.  Compared to \r\n\r\nGambelâs and scaled quail, masked bobwhites used patches of vegetation with lower exposure to \r\n\r\nground and aerial predators, lower exposure of bare ground and lower operative temperatures \r\n\r\n(Guthery et al. 2000).  By increasing the canopy coverage of brush or its functional equivalent (e.g. \r\n\r\ntall herbaceous cover) the quantity of usable space would be increased (Guthery 1997) thereby \r\n\r\nallowing the populations of masked bobwhite to increase (Guthery et al. 2000)  \r\n"

Band-rumped storm-petrels are a small seabird measuring approximately 8 inches (20 centimeters) long with a wingspan of 19 in (47 cm), and weighing about 2 ounces (50 grams). The tail is only slightly notched and is almost square in appearance. Plumage is an overall blackish-brown with a white band across the rump, just above the tail. This species typically flies with a relatively shallow wing-beat and glides on slightly bowed wings as a regular part of flight (Slotterback 2002, p. 2). Both sexes are alike in size and appearance. Vocalizations at breeding colonies can be used to further distinguish this species from other Procellariiformes seabirds (albatrosses and petrels) found throughout Hawaii (Allan 1962, p. 279; James and Robertson 1985, pp. 391392). Band-rumped storm-petrels are long-lived (15 to 20 years). When not at nesting sites, adults spend their time foraging on the open ocean for small fish, squid, and crustaceans"

This damselfly is a relatively small, dark colored species, with adults measuring 1.3 to 1.4 in (34 to 37 mm) in length and having a wingspan of 1.3 to 1.6 in (33 to 42 mm). Both adult males and females are mostly black in color. Males exhibit brick-red striping and patterns, while females exhibit light-green striping and patterns.

      "speciesDescription": "The Paiute cutthroat trout is a distinctive member of the cutthroat trout complex, distinguishable from other cutthroat trouts by body coloration and the absence, or near absence, of body spots.  Snyder (1933, 1934) described these fish as a new species, (Salmo seleniris), based on: 1) absence of body spots; 2) slender body form; 3) relatively small scales; and 4) vivid coloration. Subsequent comparisons of the type specimens with other cutthroat subspecies (Ryan and Nicola 1976, Behnke 1980) revealed that the meristic and morphometric characters for Paiute cutthroat trout are also typical of those characterizing Lahontan cutthroat trout.  Behnke and Zarn (1976) concluded, on the basis of gillraker comparisons, that the separation of Paiute cutthroat from Lahontan cutthroat occurred relatively recently, (no more than 5,000 to 8,000 years ago), following the desiccation of Lake Lahontan.  Paiute cutthroat trout and Lahontan cutthroat trout both typically possess 150-180 lateral series scales, 60-63 total vertebrae, 50-70 pyloric caeca, and 21-27 gill rakers.  ",
      "habitatRequirements": "Paiute cutthroat trout habitat requirements appear to be similar to those reported for other western stream-dwelling salmonids (Hickman and Raleigh 1982).  All life stages require cool, well-oxygenated waters.  Adult fish prefer stream pool habitat in low gradient meadows with undercut or overhanging banks and abundant riparian vegetation (Behnke and Zarn 1976).  Pools are important rearing habitat for juveniles and act as refuge areas during winter (Hickman and Raleigh 1982; Swales et al. 1986; Berg 1994).

      "speciesDescription": "The Paiute cutthroat trout is a distinctive member of the cutthroat trout complex, distinguishable from other cutthroat trouts by body coloration and the absence, or near absence, of body spots.  Snyder (1933, 1934) described these fish as a new species, (Salmo seleniris), based on: 1) absence of body spots; 2) slender body form; 3) relatively small scales; and 4) vivid coloration. Subsequent comparisons of the type specimens with other cutthroat subspecies (Ryan and Nicola 1976, Behnke 1980) revealed that the meristic and morphometric characters for Paiute cutthroat trout are also typical of those characterizing Lahontan cutthroat trout.  Behnke and Zarn (1976) concluded, on the basis of gillraker comparisons, that the separation of Paiute cutthroat from Lahontan cutthroat occurred relatively recently, (no more than 5,000 to 8,000 years ago), following the desiccation of Lake Lahontan.  Paiute cutthroat trout and Lahontan cutthroat trout both typically possess 150-180 lateral series scales, 60-63 total vertebrae, 50-70 pyloric caeca, and 21-27 gill rakers.  ",
      "habitatRequirements": "Paiute cutthroat trout habitat requirements appear to be similar to those reported for other western stream-dwelling salmonids (Hickman and Raleigh 1982).  All life stages require cool, well-oxygenated waters.  Adult fish prefer stream pool habitat in low gradient meadows with undercut or overhanging banks and abundant riparian vegetation (Behnke and Zarn 1976).  Pools are important rearing habitat for juveniles and act as refuge areas during winter (Hickman and Raleigh 1982; Swales et al. 1986; Berg 1994).  During the winter months, trout move into pools to avoid physical damage from ice scouring (Scrimgeour et al. 1994) and to conserve energy (Everest and Chapman 1972; Cunjak 1996).

In males, the horns are massive and curl up, back over the ears, then curve down, forward, and up past the cheeks. As the animals age, their horns become rough and scarred, and will vary in color from yellowish-brown to dark brown. In comparison to many other desert bighorn sheep, the horns of the Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep are generally more divergent as they coil out from the base. Adult male sheep stand up to 1 meter (3 feet) tall at the shoulder; males weigh up to 99 kilograms (220 pounds) and females 63 kilograms (140 pounds).",
      "habitatRequirements": "Optimal bighorn sheep habitat is visually open and contains steep, generally rocky, slopes. Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep avoid forests and thick brush but will use open woodland habitats on rocky slopes. Fire can play an important role in creating or improving bighorn sheep habitat in some ecosystems by increasing the visibility of predators. Large expanses lacking precipitous escape terrain, such as the Owens Valley, can be substantial barriers to movement. Even within mountain ranges like the Sierra Nevada, bighorn sheep habitat is patchy, and the population structure is naturally fragmented (Bleich et al. 1990a). This naturally fragmented distribution of Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep results in distinct herds, which make up a metapopulation. ",

Its fur is long and soft, dark brown to black at the base, followed by a broad band of cream color, then a slightly narrower band of mahogany brown, tipped with white. The outer three colors are visible from the surface, giving the fur a hoary appearance. The bat has a distinctive yellowish-brown collar under its chin and yellowish ears edged in black. Dense fur extends to the tip of its tail and just beyond the wrists along the undersides of its wings, with distinctive white patches on the shoulders and wrists.

The beaks are located somewhat anterior of the middle, and are swollen, turned forward and inward, and extended above the hingeline (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162).  Beak sculpture consists of three or four faint, double-looped bars (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162; Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 108).  The anterior end of the shell is rounded, and the posterior end is truncated, highly so in females.  The posterior ridge is prominent, being high and rounded, while the posterior slope is widely flattened.  The posterior ridge and slope in females is covered with fine ridges and grooves, and the posterioventral shell edge is finely toothed (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162).  The ventral margin is slightly rounded in males and nearly straight in females.  Females have recurved denticles (downward curved tooth-like structures) on the posterior shell margin that aid in holding host fish (Barnhart 2008, p. 1).  The periostracum (external shell surface) is generally smooth and yellowish or yellowish-green in young individuals, becoming darker with age.  Green, squarish, triangular, or chevron-shaped marks cover the umbone (the inflated area of the shell along the dorsal margin), but become poorly delineated stripes with age.  Internally, the left valve has two high, thin, triangular, emarginate pseudocardinal teeth (the front tooth being thinner than the back tooth) and two short, strong, slightly curved, and finely striated lateral teeth.  The right valve has a high, triangular pseudocardinal tooth with a single short, erect, and heavy lateral tooth.  The interdentum (a flattened area between the pseudocardinal and lateral teeth) is absent, and the beak cavity is wide and deep.  The color of the nacre is white, often with a silvery luster, and a gray-blue or gray-green tinge in the beak cavity.  Key characters useful for distinguishing the snuffbox from other species include its unique color pattern, shape (especially in females), and high degree of inflation.  \r\n\r\n",

Listed as a subspecies of the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), this species is distributed across all of the major islands of the Hawaiian archipelago, including Kauai, Oahu, Lanai, Maui, Molokai, and Hawaii. Most recently, it has been observed visiting the island of Kahoolawe (KIRC 2017). The Hawaiian hoary bat is a distinctively marked bat with long narrow wings. Its fur is long and soft, dark brown to black at the base, followed by a broad band of cream color, then a slightly narrower band of mahogany brown, tipped with white. The outer three colors are visible from the surface, giving the fur a hoary appearance. The bat has a distinctive yellowish-brown collar under its chin and yellowish ears edged in black. Dense fur extends to the tip of its tail and just beyond the wrists along the undersides of its wings, with distinctive white patches on the shoulders and wrists. Its forearm measures 50-57 mm and this bat weighs 20-38 g.

Band-rumped storm-petrels are a small seabird measuring approximately 8 inches (20 centimeters) long with a wingspan of 19 in (47 cm), and weighing about 2 ounces (50 grams). The tail is only slightly notched and is almost square in appearance. Plumage is an overall blackish-brown with a white band across the rump, just above the tail. This species typically flies with a relatively shallow wing-beat and glides on slightly bowed wings as a regular part of flight (Slotterback 2002, p. 2). Both sexes are alike in size and appearance. Vocalizations at breeding colonies can be used to further distinguish this species from other Procellariiformes seabirds (albatrosses and petrels) found throughout Hawaii (Allan 1962, p. 279; James and Robertson 1985, pp. 391392).

      "speciesDescription": "The adult male masked bobwhite has a rich rufous-red (cinnamon)\r\nbreast and a black head and throat. Some males have a white \r\nto yellowish-white superciliary stripe and sometimes touches of white   \r\nelsewhere on the head. They have crowns mottled with black and rufous.  \r\nThe head plumage tends to become purer black with age.  The back\r\nfeathers are a maze of blacks, browns, rufous and buff, somewhat\r\nsimilar to the back patterns of other bobwhite races.\r\n\r\nThe female plumage is mottled brown, buff and white with a buff\r\nthroat and superciliary stripe very similar to females of other \r\nbobwhite races.  It is particularly like the female of C. v. texanus.\r\nFemale masked bobwhite superficially resemble female and juvenile Montezuma quail, Cyrtonyx montezumae.\r\n\r\nGuthery (et al. 2000) conducted a study comparing habitats of Texas bobwhites and masked \r\n\r\nbobwhites in both Arizona and Sonora.  Habitat was determined to be similar for both sub-species,but bobwhites in Texas and Arizona preferred areas with 20-100% coverage of woody vegetation\r\n\r\nwhile Sonoran birds used areas with 9-46% coverage.   Sonoran masked bobwhites selected for \r\n\r\nhigher canopy cover of herbaceous vegetation (34-100%), while Arizona masked bobwhites used \r\n\r\nareas with 17-100% herbaceous cover. Texas bobwhites used areas with 0-30% herbaceous cover.\r\n\r\nIn another study Guthery et al. (2001b) noted that an acceptable range for a particular habitat \r\n\r\ncomponent was influenced by other habitat components.  For example, in Sonora, the acceptable \r\n\r\nrange for canopy coverage of woody vegetation ranged from 0-60% when all other habitat features \r\n\r\nwere at acceptable values, but constricted (15-40%) when other features were not at acceptable \r\n\r\nlevels.  He thereby hypothesized that habitat management could address a deficiency in one habitat \r\n\r\nvariable by managing other variables.\r\n\r\nExposure to aerial predators and high temperatures greatly affects habitat selection.  Compared to \r\n\r\nGambelâs and scaled quail, masked bobwhites used patches of vegetation with lower exposure to \r\n\r\nground and aerial predators, lower exposure of bare ground and lower operative temperatures \r\n\r\n(Guthery et al. 2000).  By increasing the canopy coverage of brush or its functional equivalent (e.g. \r\n\r\ntall herbaceous cover) the quantity of usable space would be increased (Guthery 1997) thereby \r\n\r\nallowing the populations of masked bobwhite to increase (Guthery et al. 2000)  \r\n",
      "habitatRequirements": "Little is known about the life history, ecology and preferred habitat conditions for masked bobwhites.  However, it is well documented that habitat needs for many of the sub-species of Northern bobwhite tend to be similar with respect to vegetation structure, but that plant species compositions throughout the various geographic ranges of these sub-species may vary significantly (Guthery et al. 2000).  The basics required are a wide variety of forbs and associated insects for food, grasses of the appropriate density and conformation for nesting, and shrubs for escape cover and thermoregulation.  \r\n\r\nIt is assumed, therefore, that plant species preferred by masked bobwhites are indicative of native plants species present in mesic, subtropical Sonoran grassland areas within the historic range of masked bobwhites. In addition to key plant species described above, important native plant species associated with masked bobwhite habitats areas include a wide variety of native forbs, annual and biennial grass, perennial bunch grass, leguminous shrub and tree species.  These include ragweed (Ambrosia spp.), rothrockâs gramma (Bouteloua rothrockii), Arizona cottontop, cane beardgrass \r\n(Bothriochloa barbinodis), vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum),  sacaton, blue gramma (Bouteloua gracilis),  whiteball acacia, wolf-berry (Lycium spp.), gray-thorn (Zizphus obtusifolia), and desert hackberry (Celtis pallid) (Brown and Ellis 1977, Tomlinson 1972a;1972b; 1984, Wells 2005, Goodwin and Hungerford 1977, Goodwin 1982, Steve McLaughlin pers. com.).\r\n\r\nWhile not previously documented, refuge biologists have observed a close association with pen reared and released masked bobwhites and wait-a-minute shrub (Mimosa biuncifera) and Gatuno shrub (Mimosa dysocarpa).  It is thought that mimosa shrubs provide an essential winter food from dehisced seeds and needed cover and serve as a segregate to the dense stands of whiteball acacia and bundleflower shrubs found in prime bobwhite habitat areas of Sonora.\r\n\r\nNesting cover consists primarily of bunch grasses.  Any clump that is âthe diameter of a basketball or pie plateâ and greater than 8 inches tall is appropriate nesting habitat (Angelo et al. 2005). Bunches should not exceed 500 per acre, the ideal being roughly 300 per acre. Woody cover is as essential as loafing cover for providing protection from predators year round and thermal protection in both winter and summer.  Ideal brush cover is between 3 and 10 feet tall and distributed across the landscape.  Brush should be dense above and open at ground level. In northern bobwhite regions the Huggins 50:50 Rule is the standard: âA bobwhite should never be more than 50 yards from a clump of brush 50 feet in diameterâ (Angelo et al. 2005).  \r\n\r\nScreening cover with bare ground or short ground cover is needed.  Nests are normally located within 50-60 feet of openings such as disked strips, roads or fields.  Baby quail are unable to fly and need bare ground in order to move.  An overstory of weeds and grasses screen the young quail from predators.  The growth form of the screening cover is most desirable when it forms dense clumps that provide a closed canopy above the quail and bare ground beneath.  The majority of the food for the birds in the fall and winter comes from forb seeds.  In addition, forbs attract insects which provide food for young quail. Ground cover should be at least 8 inches tall, but less than 2 ft. tall (Angelo et al. 2005).  \r\n\r\nInterspersion of the various cover types is essential.  A standard rule of thumb is to provide all the needed cover types on every acre of land (Angelo et al. 2005)",

The inside of the shell (nacre) is whitish or purplish and moderately iridescent (refer to Johnson 1983 for a full description). The Alabama pearlshell is one of five North American species in the family Margaritiferidae. The family is represented by only two genera, Margaritifera (Schumacher 1816) and Cumberlandia (Ortmann 1912). In Alabama, each genus is represented by a single speciesâthe spectaclecase (Cumberlandia monodonta) occurs in the Tennessee River Basin (Williams et al. 2008, pp. 94â95), and the Alabama pearlshell occurs in the Escambia and Alabama river basins in south Alabama.

      "speciesDescription": "Dudley Bluffs twinpod is a herbaceous (non-woody) plant species in the mustard family (Brassicaceae).  It is a compact plant with many raised branches arising from a deep tap root.  The plant grows on average 4 to 7 inches tall and 7 inches wide. Stems are smooth and narrow with oval to arrowhead shaped leaves that are very dense at the base.  Dudley Bluffs twinpods clusters of bright-yellow flowers bloom for a short time between mid-May and June.  Dudley Bluffs twinpod is a close relative of the common sharpleaf twinpod (Physaria acutifolia) and it can be difficult to distinguish the two species at a glance.    \r\nDudley Bluffs twinpod is only known to occur in the general area of Piceance Creek in Rio Blanco County in western Colorado, near the town of Meeker.  The species is restricted to barren (sparsely vegetated), white outcrops and steep slopes of the Parachute Creek Member and certain tongues of the Green River Formation.  Its habitat is unique because it supports the growth of only a few plants that can tolerate difficult growing conditions.  \r\n\r\nWhy does the Dudley Bluffs twinpod need protection?\r\nThe unique geology of the Piceance Creek area is important to the Dudley Bluffs twinpod (and many other endemic plant species).  It is also part of the Piceance Basins multimineral oil shale zone, an area containing large reserves of oil shale, natural gas, and minerals.  However, energy exploration, extraction, and the many associated activities in the region can disturb or degrade the fragile shale habitats. They can also pose a threat to native ground nesting bees that pollinate Dudley Bluffs twinpod.  Other threats include weed invasion and increased access to these remote areas by recreationists.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n",

The pearlshell is oblong and grows up to 95 millimeters (mm) (3.8 inches (in)) in length. The outside of the shell (periostracum) is smooth and shiny and somewhat roughened along the posterior slope. The inside of the shell (nacre) is whitish or purplish and moderately iridescent (refer to Johnson 1983 for a full description). The Alabama pearlshell is one of five North American species in the family Margaritiferidae. The family is represented by only two genera, Margaritifera (Schumacher 1816) and Cumberlandia (Ortmann 1912). In Alabama, each genus is represented by a single speciesâthe spectaclecase (Cumberlandia monodonta) occurs in the Tennessee River Basin (Williams et al. 2008, pp. 94â95), and the Alabama pearlshell occurs in the Escambia and Alabama river basins in south Alabama. Prior to 1983, the Alabama pearlshell was thought to be the same species as the Louisiana pearlshell (Margaritifera hembeli Conrad 1838) (Simpson 1914; Clench and Turner 1956), a species now considered endemic to central Louisiana.",

      "speciesDescription": "The adult male masked bobwhite has a rich rufous-red (cinnamon)\r\nbreast and a black head and throat. Some males have a white \r\nto yellowish-white superciliary stripe and sometimes touches of white   \r\nelsewhere on the head. They have crowns mottled with black and rufous.  \r\nThe head plumage tends to become purer black with age.  The back\r\nfeathers are a maze of blacks, browns, rufous and buff, somewhat\r\nsimilar to the back patterns of other bobwhite races.\r\n\r\nThe female plumage is mottled brown, buff and white with a buff\r\nthroat and superciliary stripe very similar to females of other \r\nbobwhite races.  It is particularly like the female of C. v. texanus.\r\nFemale masked bobwhite superficially resemble female and juvenile Montezuma quail, Cyrtonyx montezumae.\r\n\r\nGuthery (et al. 2000) conducted a study comparing habitats of Texas bobwhites and masked \r\n\r\nbobwhites in both Arizona and Sonora.  Habitat was determined to be similar for both sub-species,but bobwhites in Texas and Arizona preferred areas with 20-100% coverage of woody vegetation\r\n\r\nwhile Sonoran birds used areas with 9-46% coverage.   Sonoran masked bobwhites selected for \r\n\r\nhigher canopy cover of herbaceous vegetation (34-100%), while Arizona masked bobwhites used \r\n\r\nareas with 17-100% herbaceous cover. Texas bobwhites used areas with 0-30% herbaceous cover.\r\n\r\nIn another study Guthery et al. (2001b) noted that an acceptable range for a particular habitat \r\n\r\ncomponent was influenced by other habitat components.  For example, in Sonora, the acceptable \r\n\r\nrange for canopy coverage of woody vegetation ranged from 0-60% when all other habitat features \r\n\r\nwere at acceptable values, but constricted (15-40%) when other features were not at acceptable \r\n\r\nlevels.  He thereby hypothesized that habitat management could address a deficiency in one habitat \r\n\r\nvariable by managing other variables.\r\n\r\nExposure to aerial predators and high temperatures greatly affects habitat selection.  Compared to \r\n\r\nGambelâs and scaled quail, masked bobwhites used patches of vegetation with lower exposure to \r\n\r\nground and aerial predators, lower exposure of bare ground and lower operative temperatures \r\n\r\n(Guthery et al. 2000).  By increasing the canopy coverage of brush or its functional equivalent (e.g. \r\n\r\ntall herbaceous cover) the quantity of usable space would be increased (Guthery 1997) thereby \r\n\r\nallowing the populations of masked bobwhite to increase (Guthery et al. 2000)  \r\n",
      "habitatRequirements": "Little is known about the life history, ecology and preferred habitat conditions for masked bobwhites.  However, it is well documented that habitat needs for many of the sub-species of Northern bobwhite tend to be similar with respect to vegetation structure, but that plant species compositions throughout the various geographic ranges of these sub-species may vary significantly (Guthery et al. 2000).  The basics required are a wide variety of forbs and associated insects for food, grasses of the appropriate density and conformation for nesting, and shrubs for escape cover and thermoregulation.  \r\n\r\nIt is assumed, therefore, that plant species preferred by masked bobwhites are indicative of native plants species present in mesic, subtropical Sonoran grassland areas within the historic range of masked bobwhites. In addition to key plant species described above, important native plant species associated with masked bobwhite habitats areas include a wide variety of native forbs, annual and biennial grass, perennial bunch grass, leguminous shrub and tree species.  These include ragweed (Ambrosia spp.), rothrockâs gramma (Bouteloua rothrockii), Arizona cottontop, cane beardgrass \r\n(Bothriochloa barbinodis), vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum),  sacaton, blue gramma (Bouteloua gracilis),  whiteball acacia, wolf-berry (Lycium spp.), gray-thorn (Zizphus obtusifolia), and desert hackberry (Celtis pallid) (Brown and Ellis 1977, Tomlinson 1972a;1972b; 1984, Wells 2005, Goodwin and Hungerford 1977, Goodwin 1982, Steve McLaughlin pers. com.).\r\n\r\nWhile not previously documented, refuge biologists have observed a close association with pen reared and released masked bobwhites and wait-a-minute shrub (Mimosa biuncifera) and Gatuno shrub (Mimosa dysocarpa).  It is thought that mimosa shrubs provide an essential winter food from dehisced seeds and needed cover and serve as a segregate to the dense stands of whiteball acacia and bundleflower shrubs found in prime bobwhite habitat areas of Sonora.\r\n\r\nNesting cover consists primarily of bunch grasses.  Any clump that is âthe diameter of a basketball or pie plateâ and greater than 8 inches tall is appropriate nesting habitat (Angelo et al. 2005). Bunches should not exceed 500 per acre, the ideal being roughly 300 per acre. Woody cover is as essential as loafing cover for providing protection from predators year round and thermal protection in both winter and summer.  Ideal brush cover is between 3 and 10 feet tall and distributed across the landscape.  Brush should be dense above and open at ground level. In northern bobwhite regions the Huggins 50:50 Rule is the standard: âA bobwhite should never be more than 50 yards from a clump of brush 50 feet in diameterâ (Angelo et al. 2005).  \r\n\r\nScreening cover with bare ground or short ground cover is needed.  Nests are normally located within 50-60 feet of openings such as disked strips, roads or fields.  Baby quail are unable to fly and need bare ground in order to move.  An overstory of weeds and grasses screen the young quail from predators.  The growth form of the screening cover is most desirable when it forms dense clumps that provide a closed canopy above the quail and bare ground beneath.  The majority of the food for the birds in the fall and winter comes from forb seeds.  In addition, forbs attract insects which provide food for young quail. Ground cover should be at least 8 inches tall, but less than 2 ft. tall (Angelo et al. 2005).  \r\n\r\nInterspersion of the various cover types is essential.  A standard rule of thumb is to provide all the needed cover types on every acre of land (Angelo et al. 2005)",

Band-rumped storm-petrels are a small seabird measuring approximately 8 inches (20 centimeters) long with a wingspan of 19 in (47 cm), and weighing about 2 ounces (50 grams). The tail is only slightly notched and is almost square in appearance. Plumage is an overall blackish-brown with a white band across the rump, just above the tail. This species typically flies with a relatively shallow wing-beat and glides on slightly bowed wings as a regular part of flight (Slotterback 2002, p. 2). Both sexes are alike in size and appearance. Vocalizations at breeding colonies can be used to further distinguish this species from other Procellariiformes seabirds (albatrosses and petrels) found throughout Hawaii (Allan 1962, p. 279; James and Robertson 1985, pp. 391392). Band-rumped storm-petrels are long-lived (15 to 20 years). When not at nesting sites, adults spend their time foraging on the open ocean for small fish, squid, and crustaceans",

      "speciesDescription": "The Alabama pearlshell (Margaritifera marrianae, Johnson 1983) is a medium sized freshwater mussel known from a few tributaries of the Alabama and Escambia River drainages in southcentral Alabama (Johnson 1983, pp. 299â304; McGregor 2004, p. 40; Williams et al. 2008, pp. 98â99). The pearlshell is oblong and grows up to 95 millimeters (mm) (3.8 inches (in)) in length. The outside of the shell (periostracum) is smooth and shiny and somewhat roughened along the posterior slope. The inside of the shell (nacre) is whitish or purplish and moderately iridescent (refer to Johnson 1983 for a full description). The Alabama pearlshell is one of five North American species in the family Margaritiferidae. The family is represented by only two genera, Margaritifera (Schumacher 1816) and Cumberlandia (Ortmann 1912). In Alabama, each genus is represented by a single speciesâthe spectaclecase (Cumberlandia monodonta) occurs in the Tennessee River Basin (Williams et al. 2008, pp. 94â95), and the Alabama pearlshell occurs in the Escambia and Alabama river basins in south Alabama. Prior to 1983, the Alabama pearlshell was thought to be the same species as the Louisiana pearlshell (Margaritifera hembeli Conrad 1838) (Simpson 1914; Clench and Turner 1956), a species now considered endemic to central Louisiana.",

      "speciesDescription": "The adult male masked bobwhite has a rich rufous-red (cinnamon)\r\nbreast and a black head and throat. Some males have a white \r\nto yellowish-white superciliary stripe and sometimes touches of white   \r\nelsewhere on the head. They have crowns mottled with black and rufous.  \r\nThe head plumage tends to become purer black with age.  The back\r\nfeathers are a maze of blacks, browns, rufous and buff, somewhat\r\nsimilar to the back patterns of other bobwhite races.\r\n\r\nThe female plumage is mottled brown, buff and white with a buff\r\nthroat and superciliary stripe very similar to females of other \r\nbobwhite races.  It is particularly like the female of C. v. texanus.\r\nFemale masked bobwhite superficially resemble female and juvenile Montezuma quail, Cyrtonyx montezumae.\r\n\r\nGuthery (et al. 2000) conducted a study comparing habitats of Texas bobwhites and masked \r\n\r\nbobwhites in both Arizona and Sonora.  Habitat was determined to be similar for both sub-species,but bobwhites in Texas and Arizona preferred areas with 20-100% coverage of woody vegetation\r\n\r\nwhile Sonoran birds used areas with 9-46% coverage.   Sonoran masked bobwhites selected for \r\n\r\nhigher canopy cover of herbaceous vegetation (34-100%), while Arizona masked bobwhites used \r\n\r\nareas with 17-100% herbaceous cover. Texas bobwhites used areas with 0-30% herbaceous cover.\r\n\r\nIn another study Guthery et al. (2001b) noted that an acceptable range for a particular habitat \r\n\r\ncomponent was influenced by other habitat components.  For example, in Sonora, the acceptable \r\n\r\nrange for canopy coverage of woody vegetation ranged from 0-60% when all other habitat features \r\n\r\nwere at acceptable values, but constricted (15-40%) when other features were not at acceptable \r\n\r\nlevels.  He thereby hypothesized that habitat management could address a deficiency in one habitat \r\n\r\nvariable by managing other variables.\r\n\r\nExposure to aerial predators and high temperatures greatly affects habitat selection.  Compared to \r\n\r\nGambelâs and scaled quail, masked bobwhites used patches of vegetation with lower exposure to \r\n\r\nground and aerial predators, lower exposure of bare ground and lower operative temperatures \r\n\r\n(Guthery et al. 2000).  By increasing the canopy coverage of brush or its functional equivalent (e.g. \r\n\r\ntall herbaceous cover) the quantity of usable space would be increased (Guthery 1997) thereby \r\n\r\nallowing the populations of masked bobwhite to increase (Guthery et al. 2000)  \r\n",
      "habitatRequirements": "Little is known about the life history, ecology and preferred habitat conditions for masked bobwhites.  However, it is well documented that habitat needs for many of the sub-species of Northern bobwhite tend to be similar with respect to vegetation structure, but that plant species compositions throughout the various geographic ranges of these sub-species may vary significantly (Guthery et al. 2000).  The basics required are a wide variety of forbs and associated insects for food, grasses of the appropriate density and conformation for nesting, and shrubs for escape cover and thermoregulation.  \r\n\r\nIt is assumed, therefore, that plant species preferred by masked bobwhites are indicative of native plants species present in mesic, subtropical Sonoran grassland areas within the historic range of masked bobwhites. In addition to key plant species described above, important native plant species associated with masked bobwhite habitats areas include a wide variety of native forbs, annual and biennial grass, perennial bunch grass, leguminous shrub and tree species.  These include ragweed (Ambrosia spp.), rothrockâs gramma (Bouteloua rothrockii), Arizona cottontop, cane beardgrass \r\n(Bothriochloa barbinodis), vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum),  sacaton, blue gramma (Bouteloua gracilis),  whiteball acacia, wolf-berry (Lycium spp.), gray-thorn (Zizphus obtusifolia), and desert hackberry (Celtis pallid) (Brown and Ellis 1977, Tomlinson 1972a;1972b; 1984, Wells 2005, Goodwin and Hungerford 1977, Goodwin 1982, Steve McLaughlin pers. com.).\r\n\r\nWhile not previously documented, refuge biologists have observed a close association with pen reared and released masked bobwhites and wait-a-minute shrub (Mimosa biuncifera) and Gatuno shrub (Mimosa dysocarpa).  It is thought that mimosa shrubs provide an essential winter food from dehisced seeds and needed cover and serve as a segregate to the dense stands of whiteball acacia and bundleflower shrubs found in prime bobwhite habitat areas of Sonora.\r\n\r\nNesting cover consists primarily of bunch grasses.  Any clump that is âthe diameter of a basketball or pie plateâ and greater than 8 inches tall is appropriate nesting habitat (Angelo et al. 2005). Bunches should not exceed 500 per acre, the ideal being roughly 300 per acre. Woody cover is as essential as loafing cover for providing protection from predators year round and thermal protection in both winter and summer.  Ideal brush cover is between 3 and 10 feet tall and distributed across the landscape.  Brush should be dense above and open at ground level. In northern bobwhite regions the Huggins 50:50 Rule is the standard: âA bobwhite should never be more than 50 yards from a clump of brush 50 feet in diameterâ (Angelo et al. 2005).  \r\n\r\nScreening cover with bare ground or short ground cover is needed.  Nests are normally located within 50-60 feet of openings such as disked strips, roads or fields.  Baby quail are unable to fly and need bare ground in order to move.  An overstory of weeds and grasses screen the young quail from predators.  The growth form of the screening cover is most desirable when it forms dense clumps that provide a closed canopy above the quail and bare ground beneath.  The majority of the food for the birds in the fall and winter comes from forb seeds.  In addition, forbs attract insects which provide food for young quail. Ground cover should be at least 8 inches tall, but less than 2 ft. tall (Angelo et al. 2005).  \r\n\r\nInterspersion of the various cover types is essential.  A standard rule of thumb is to provide all the needed cover types on every acre of land (Angelo et al. 2005)",

Stems are smooth and narrow with oval to arrowhead shaped leaves that are very dense at the base.  Dudley Bluffs twinpods clusters of bright-yellow flowers bloom for a short time between mid-May and June.  Dudley Bluffs twinpod is a close relative of the common sharpleaf twinpod (Physaria acutifolia) and it can be difficult to distinguish the two species at a glance.    \r\nDudley Bluffs twinpod is only known to occur in the general area of Piceance Creek in Rio Blanco County in western Colorado, near the town of Meeker.  The species is restricted to barren (sparsely vegetated), white outcrops and steep slopes of the Parachute Creek Member and certain tongues of the Green River Formation.  Its habitat is unique because it supports the growth of only a few plants that can tolerate difficult growing conditions.  \r\n\r\nWhy does the Dudley Bluffs twinpod need protection?\r\nThe unique geology of the Piceance Creek area is important to the Dudley Bluffs twinpod (and many other endemic plant species).  It is also part of the Piceance Basins multimineral oil shale zone, an area containing large reserves of oil shale, natural gas, and minerals.  However, energy exploration, extraction, and the many associated activities in the region can disturb or degrade the fragile shale habitats. They can also pose a threat to native ground nesting bees that pollinate Dudley Bluffs twinpod.  Other threats include weed invasion and increased access to these remote areas by recreationists.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "speciesDescription": "The adult male masked bobwhite has a rich rufous-red (cinnamon)\r\nbreast and a black head and throat. Some males have a white \r\nto yellowish-white superciliary stripe and sometimes touches of white   \r\nelsewhere on the head. They have crowns mottled with black and rufous.  \r\nThe head plumage tends to become purer black with age.  The back\r\nfeathers are a maze of blacks, browns, rufous and buff, somewhat\r\nsimilar to the back patterns of other bobwhite races.\r\n\r\nThe female plumage is mottled brown, buff and white with a buff\r\nthroat and superciliary stripe very similar to females of other \r\nbobwhite races.  It is particularly like the female of C. v. texanus.\r\nFemale masked bobwhite superficially resemble female and juvenile Montezuma quail, Cyrtonyx montezumae.\r\n\r\nGuthery (et al. 2000) conducted a study comparing habitats of Texas bobwhites and masked \r\n\r\nbobwhites in both Arizona and Sonora.  Habitat was determined to be similar for both sub-species,but bobwhites in Texas and Arizona preferred areas with 20-100% coverage of woody vegetation\r\n\r\nwhile Sonoran birds used areas with 9-46% coverage.   Sonoran masked bobwhites selected for \r\n\r\nhigher canopy cover of herbaceous vegetation (34-100%), while Arizona masked bobwhites used \r\n\r\nareas with 17-100% herbaceous cover. Texas bobwhites used areas with 0-30% herbaceous cover.\r\n\r\nIn another study Guthery et al. (2001b) noted that an acceptable range for a particular habitat \r\n\r\ncomponent was influenced by other habitat components.  For example, in Sonora, the acceptable \r\n\r\nrange for canopy coverage of woody vegetation ranged from 0-60% when all other habitat features \r\n\r\nwere at acceptable values, but constricted (15-40%) when other features were not at acceptable \r\n\r\nlevels.  He thereby hypothesized that habitat management could address a deficiency in one habitat \r\n\r\nvariable by managing other variables.\r\n\r\nExposure to aerial predators and high temperatures greatly affects habitat selection.  Compared to \r\n\r\nGambelâs and scaled quail, masked bobwhites used patches of vegetation with lower exposure to \r\n\r\nground and aerial predators, lower exposure of bare ground and lower operative temperatures \r\n\r\n(Guthery et al. 2000).  By increasing the canopy coverage of brush or its functional equivalent (e.g. \r\n\r\ntall herbaceous cover) the quantity of usable space would be increased (Guthery 1997) thereby \r\n\r\nallowing the populations of masked bobwhite to increase (Guthery et al. 2000)  \r\n",
      "habitatRequirements": "Little is known about the life history, ecology and preferred habitat conditions for masked bobwhites.  However, it is well documented that habitat needs for many of the sub-species of Northern bobwhite tend to be similar with respect to vegetation structure, but that plant species compositions throughout the various geographic ranges of these sub-species may vary significantly (Guthery et al. 2000).  The basics required are a wide variety of forbs and associated insects for food, grasses of the appropriate density and conformation for nesting, and shrubs for escape cover and thermoregulation.  \r\n\r\nIt is assumed, therefore, that plant species preferred by masked bobwhites are indicative of native plants species present in mesic, subtropical Sonoran grassland areas within the historic range of masked bobwhites. In addition to key plant species described above, important native plant species associated with masked bobwhite habitats areas include a wide variety of native forbs, annual and biennial grass, perennial bunch grass, leguminous shrub and tree species.  These include ragweed (Ambrosia spp.), rothrockâs gramma (Bouteloua rothrockii), Arizona cottontop, cane beardgrass \r\n(Bothriochloa barbinodis), vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum),  sacaton, blue gramma (Bouteloua gracilis),  whiteball acacia, wolf-berry (Lycium spp.), gray-thorn (Zizphus obtusifolia), and desert hackberry (Celtis pallid) (Brown and Ellis 1977, Tomlinson 1972a;1972b; 1984, Wells 2005, Goodwin and Hungerford 1977, Goodwin 1982, Steve McLaughlin pers. com.).\r\n\r\nWhile not previously documented, refuge biologists have observed a close association with pen reared and released masked bobwhites and wait-a-minute shrub (Mimosa biuncifera) and Gatuno shrub (Mimosa dysocarpa).  It is thought that mimosa shrubs provide an essential winter food from dehisced seeds and needed cover and serve as a segregate to the dense stands of whiteball acacia and bundleflower shrubs found in prime bobwhite habitat areas of Sonora.\r\n\r\nNesting cover consists primarily of bunch grasses.  Any clump that is âthe diameter of a basketball or pie plateâ and greater than 8 inches tall is appropriate nesting habitat (Angelo et al. 2005). Bunches should not exceed 500 per acre, the ideal being roughly 300 per acre. Woody cover is as essential as loafing cover for providing protection from predators year round and thermal protection in both winter and summer.  Ideal brush cover is between 3 and 10 feet tall and distributed across the landscape.  Brush should be dense above and open at ground level. In northern bobwhite regions the Huggins 50:50 Rule is the standard: âA bobwhite should never be more than 50 yards from a clump of brush 50 feet in diameterâ (Angelo et al. 2005).  \r\n\r\nScreening cover with bare ground or short ground cover is needed.  Nests are normally located within 50-60 feet of openings such as disked strips, roads or fields.  Baby quail are unable to fly and need bare ground in order to move.  An overstory of weeds and grasses screen the young quail from predators.  The growth form of the screening cover is most desirable when it forms dense clumps that provide a closed canopy above the quail and bare ground beneath.  The majority of the food for the birds in the fall and winter comes from forb seeds.  In addition, forbs attract insects which provide food for young quail. Ground cover should be at least 8 inches tall, but less than 2 ft. tall (Angelo et al. 2005).  \r\n\r\nInterspersion of the various cover types is essential.  A standard rule of thumb is to provide all the needed cover types on every acre of land (Angelo et al. 2005)",

      "speciesDescription": "The Alabama pearlshell (Margaritifera marrianae, Johnson 1983) is a medium sized freshwater mussel known from a few tributaries of the Alabama and Escambia River drainages in southcentral Alabama (Johnson 1983, pp. 299â304; McGregor 2004, p. 40; Williams et al. 2008, pp. 98â99). The pearlshell is oblong and grows up to 95 millimeters (mm) (3.8 inches (in)) in length. The outside of the shell (periostracum) is smooth and shiny and somewhat roughened along the posterior slope. The inside of the shell (nacre) is whitish or purplish and moderately iridescent (refer to Johnson 1983 for a full description). The Alabama pearlshell is one of five North American species in the family Margaritiferidae. The family is represented by only two genera, Margaritifera (Schumacher 1816) and Cumberlandia (Ortmann 1912). In Alabama, each genus is represented by a single speciesâthe spectaclecase (Cumberlandia monodonta) occurs in the Tennessee River Basin (Williams et al. 2008, pp. 94â95), and the Alabama pearlshell occurs in the Escambia and Alabama river basins in south Alabama. Prior to 1983, the Alabama pearlshell was thought to be the same species as the Louisiana pearlshell (Margaritifera hembeli Conrad 1838) (Simpson 1914; Clench and Turner 1956), a species now considered endemic to central Louisiana.",
