          "details": "The Florida bonneted bat is a member of the Molossidae (free-tailed bats) family within the order Chiroptera. The species is the largest bat in Florida(Owre 1978; Belwood 1992). Males and females are not significantly different in size, and there is no pattern of size-related geographic variation in this species(Timm and Genoways 2004). Members of the genus Eumops have large, rounded pinnae (ears), arising from a single point or joined medially on the forehead (Best et al. 1997). Ears are joined at the midline of the head. This feature, along with its large size, distinguishes the Florida bonneted bat from the smaller Brazilian (=Mexican)free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis). Eumops are among the narrowest of all molossids (Freeman 1981, as cited in Best et al. 1997) and are well-adapted for rapid, prolonged flight (Vaughan 1959 as cited in Best et al. 1997). This wing structure is conducive to high-speed flight in open areas (Findley et al. 1972 as cited in Best et al. 1997). The Florida bonneted batÃÂ¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s fur is short and glossy, with hairs sharply bicolored with a white base (Belwood 1992; Timm and Genoways 2004). Like other molossids, color is highly variable, varying from black to brown to brownish-gray or cinnamon brown with ventral pelage (fur) paler than dorsal (Owre 1978; Belwood 1992; Timm and Genoways 2004)."

Each flower has a three-part fringed lip less than 1 inch long and a nectar spur (tube-like structure) which is about 1 to 2 inches long.The eastern prairie fringed orchid occurs in a wide variety of habitats, from mesic prairie to wetlands such as sedge meadows, marsh edges, even bogs. It requires full sun for optimum growth and flowering and a grassy habitat with little or no woody encroachment. A symbiotic relationship between the seed and soil fungi, called mycorrhizae, is necessary for seedlings to become established. This fungi helps the seeds assimilate nutrients in the soil."

In nonbreeding plumage, upperparts uniform gray to gray-brown with pale spots (most evident on wing-coverts). Underparts white with fine gray streaking on neck and breast. In autumn, juveniles resemble basic adults. However, they are browner above with more regular and profuse pale spotting on upperparts as well as indistinct streaking on breast. First winter birds are separated from adults by pale versus dark brown notching on tertials.

The Pacific Hawaiian damselfly was first described by McLachlan (1883, p. 234), based on specimens collected by R.C.L. Perkins from streams on the islands of Lanai and Maui. This damselfly is a relatively small, dark colored species, with adults measuring 1.3 to 1.4 in (34 to 37 mm) in length and having a wingspan of 1.3 to 1.6 in (33 to 42 mm). Both adult males and females are mostly black in color. Males exhibit brick-red striping and patterns, while females exhibit light-green striping and patterns. The only immature individuals of this species that have been collected were early instar (an intermoult stage of development) individuals, and they exhibit flattened, leaf-like gills (Polhemus and Asquith 1996, p. 83). Pacific Hawaiian damselflies are distinguished from other Hawaiian damselflies by the long lower abdominal appendages of the male (USFWS 2010). Pacific damselflies do not disperse over long distances compared to other Hawaiian damselfies (Jordan et al 2007, USFWS 2011)."

Behnke and Zarn (1976) concluded, on the basis of gillraker comparisons, that the separation of Paiute cutthroat from Lahontan cutthroat occurred relatively recently, (no more than 5,000 to 8,000 years ago), following the desiccation of Lake Lahontan.

Pools are important rearing habitat for juveniles and act as refuge areas during winter (Hickman and Raleigh 1982; Swales et al. 1986; Berg 1994).  During the winter months, trout move into pools to avoid physical damage from ice scouring (Scrimgeour et al. 1994) and to conserve energy (Everest and Chapman 1972; Cunjak 1996).  As with other salmonids, suitable winter habitat may be more restrictive than summer habitat (Jakober et al. 1998).  Paiute cutthroat trout survive in lakes, but there is no evidence that they ever occurred naturally in any lakes within the Silver King basin.

      "speciesDescription": "Lesser Yellowlegs are medium-sized, slender, long-legged shorebirds. Sexes are similar in plumage and overall size, but females have slightly longer wings on average. In breeding plumage, upperparts mottled gray-brown, white, and black. Underparts white with brown streaking on neck and breast and irregular, blackish barring on anterior flanks. In nonbreeding plumage, upperparts uniform gray to gray-brown with pale spots (most evident on wing-coverts). Underparts white with fine gray streaking on neck and breast. In autumn, juveniles resemble basic adults. However, they are browner above with more regular and profuse pale spotting on upperparts as well as indistinct streaking on breast. First winter birds are separated from adults by pale versus dark brown notching on tertials.  The long legs of this species are yellow year-round for all age classes.\r\n\r\n<p><b>References cited in Species Profile </b> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Bannerman, D. A. 1961. The birds of the British Isles.
